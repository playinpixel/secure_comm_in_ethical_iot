# End-to-end encrypted communication

# Introduction
Encryption of data for the sake of security is a must in today's world, with constant threats and vulnerabilities in transfer of data. 
This project captures user input on a matrix keypad, encrypts it, and displays both the original and encrypted text on two OLED screens. It demonstrates key concepts in hardware interfacing and data encryption, providing a practical example of secure data handling on embedded systems.
